                    <div class="about-me">Welcome to my page. My name is Vlad and I am a programmer.
                        Since childhood, programming and exact sciences have been my passion. In many of them, I won
                        prizes both at school and city Olympiads. The first practical application of my knowledge
                        was
                        the creation of various electronic devices based on microcontrollers. While studying at the
                        Polytechnic, I had the opportunity to participate in competitions of scientific and
                        technical
                        creativity, where, having passed the district and regional stages, I won a prize in the
                        Republican competitions. Over time, the hobby grew into a job, during which I happened to
                        use a
                        large number of advanced microelectronic technologies. Once, having accepted an offer that
                        was
                        interesting to me, I left my passion for a while and plunged into a new path of management
                        with
                        great interest. For four years, I served as an assistant to the general director in a
                        trading
                        and manufacturing company. Planning the work process, business correspondence, preparing
                        meetings and conferences, setting tasks and monitoring their implementation have become my
                        daily
                        activities. Among a large number of things, in the flow of multitasking, my tourist soul was
                        especially pleased with the next training camp and preparation for our wonderful team
                        building,
                        which, with the light hand of our beloved Director, constantly took place in new and always
                        exotic places. Having gained experience in organizing a business, I decided to try my hand
                        at
                        business and set off for free swimming 😉. Having successfully completed one ambitious
                        order, my
                        short voyage was interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. After that, having received offers
                        of
                        work as a programmer, I accepted it, deciding not to tempt fate in the coming unpredictable
                        economic situation. After that, I had the opportunity to create an automated system for
                        managing
                        and controlling business processes, write software for a wide range of laboratory
                        installations,
                        and develop a backend for modern Internet applications.
